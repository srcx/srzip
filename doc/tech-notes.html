<h2><a name="Method bwt">Method bwt</a></h2>
<p class="Body">
Whole code for bwt method is in files m_bwt.[hc] (besides that code of
method ahc from files m_ahc.[hc] is used). For generic introduction to bwt
I recommend [<a class="link" href="#1">1</a>].

<h3><a name="Individual compression stages">Individual compression stages</a></h3>
<p class="Body">
Compression is block-based with block size proportional to compression
quality. Burrows-Wheeler transformation (see [<a class="link" href="#2">2</a>]) is implemented in
function do_bwt(in_buf, out_buf, len, idx_buf), which does a
transformation of input buffer in_buf (of length len) to output buffer
out_buf. In comparison with basic transformation implementation there are
these enhancements: ring buffer is not new buffer, bur array of pointers to
input buffer (idx_buf), for quicker sorting (standard qsort() is used) eof
character is appended to the input buffer which has higher value than any
other character, this way it is not necessary to compare ring strings, but
only input suffixes. It is necessary to retain this eof character during
whole compression and decompression. This cause double speed gain. This
enhancement is based on a thought from Mark Nelson's article (see
[<a class="link" href="#3">3</a>]). Even with this enhancement the compression is very slow and that's
because of quicksort. It has worst results on data with high ratio of
repeated sections (it is necessary to compare long blocks). Sadly this is
exactly the reason for this transformation's success and it is fairly normal
for common data. For that reason different sorting method was tried and
that's suffix tree. Sadly the time gain is not too high, but memory
consumption is (around 40 times higher than quicksort). Complexity
comparison:

<caption>&nbsp;&nbsp;Complexity comparison&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</caption>
<tr><th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th> qsort&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th> stree&nbsp;&nbsp;</th></tr>
<tr><td> time  &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> O(N*log(N))&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> O(N)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td> space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> O(N)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> O(N)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="Body">
This does not look as bad, but in absolute numbers that's
different: stree consumes around 20 bytes per node (in my implementation,
normally it is 16 bytes, but with additional demands during tree walk) with
max 2*N nodes. Suffix tree implementation is in directory bwt_as_stree,
but beware that it sorts some data badly and thus generates wrong output.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Then follows Move-to-front coding implemented by function do_mtf(buffer, len),
which is not differerent from common implementations.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Finally the output is coded by ahc (adaptive huffman coding) whereas at
first zero strings are coded as pair (0, length-1), that's more or less what
is suggested in [<a class="link" href="#1">1</a>]. Zero strings are very common in mtf's output so this
improves compression ratio approximately by quarter.

<h3><a name="Individual decompression stages">Individual decompression stages</a></h3>
<p class="Body">
Compressed data are at first decompressed by ahc, coded zero strings are
decoded on-the-fly.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Then goes reverse mtf (function rev_mtf(buffer, len)), nothing interesting.
</p>
<p class="Body">
Reverse Burrows-Wheeler transformation is implemented by function
rev_bwt(in_buf, op, out_buf, buf_len, tbuf), which transforms in_buf to
out_buf, op is original data position in sorted buffer so it's also a
position of the only appeareance of eof character in the buffer.
Transformation is done by constructing the transformation vector in tbuf.

<h3><a name="Speed and achievements of the method">Speed and achievements of the method</a></h3>
<p class="Body">
Compression is very slow: in comparison to gzip (which uses dictionary-based
compression) or bzip2 (which uses bwt) it can be almost 50 times slower -
this shows the slow sorting by qsort(), bzip2 uses qsort too, but modified
(with higher memory consumption). Compression ratio is higher than gzip's
and comparable with bzip2's (worse by tenth of percents). Decompression is
very quick, comparable to other programs.
